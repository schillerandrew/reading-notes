> # Software Engineering Readings

##### These readings talked about different ways to achieve a more tenacious and productive mindset, which is great food for thought as I embark on my longest and hardest bootcamp class yet!

&nbsp;

> ### 1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

I have a lot of creative or non-technical skills, such as being a very good speller and a good communicator, that will hopefully will allow me to excel in soft skills and be able to focus more on my technical aptitude.

> ### 2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

  1.  Take a break and check my environment. Am I hungry, tired, grumpy, too hot, too cold, etc? Often a very easy adjustment can be surprising reset that affects my attitude and/or performance.

  2. See if I need more of a plan or framework for the work I'm doing -- Trello board, wireframe, etc. One of the readings talked about how the planning stage tends to be downsized, to our own detriment.

  3. Check for syntax errors and other errors using a triage method, also considering errors or breakdowns that I might expect to see and then others that are decidedly unexpected. Maybe also get better at utilizing my troubleshooting tools and approach so I can isolate and identify errors and thus be able to better understand and then troubleshoot them.
