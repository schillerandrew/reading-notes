> # Introduction to React and Components

## Components

1. component = distinct block of methods, events and properties that performs specified tasks
1. components can be more easily moved around, reused and combined to create larger products and tools
    - components can be written as a simple JS function -- for instance by using props -- or as an E6 class (`extends`, etc)
1. just like components, component-based design is more modular, flexible and reliable -- generally taking less time and cost to achieve results

## Props

1. props ("properties") are used to pass data between components or files

1. props flow downward/outward from the root and they only flow in one direction, but there are ways of "sending" data "backwards" or to the root

- props are read-only (immutable)
