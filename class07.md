1. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

1. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

    - It's the standard "Web" protocol, and used in tandem with URLs it provides a standard way of identifying a computer, so no matter what languages or platforms or protocols are being used, a computer can identify another computer.
