> # Event Driven Applications

1. What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?

EventEmitter

2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?

It allows the principles of object-oriented programming to be more easily maintained. OOP tries to keep functionality contained within objects, but over time it can be easy for the lines to blur. Event driven programming allows for some intermediary event triggering and event handling, and allows objects to remain more or less "independent" of each other.

3. Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.

The backend involves things like servers and databases, which involve a lot of request-response mechanisms. Event driven programming is well-suited for that kind of cause-effect data flow, where one action leads to another action. Event driven programming is probably useful in all kinds of areas, and definitely on the backend.
