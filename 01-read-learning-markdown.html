## Headings
- `# ` gives largest heading, all the way up to `###### ` for largest heading
- heading syntax can also be used with quote syntax

## Styling text
- **bold** = `**STRING**`
- *italics* = `*STRING*`
- ~~strikethrough~~ = `~~STRING~~`
- - **bold with _some_ italics** = `**<NON-ITAL STRING> _<ITAL STRING>_ <NON-ITAL STRING>**`
- ***bold and italics*** = `***<STRING>***`
- `> ` = pullquote
- codequote = `` `WORD` ``

## Links and Images
- link = `![ALT TEXT](URL OR FILENAME/PATH)`
- image = `![ALT TEXT](URL OR FILENAME/PATH)
  - to use dark or light them for an image = append `#gh-dark-mode-only` or `#gh-light-mode-only` to filename
- linked image = `[![ALT TEXT](IMAGE URL OR FILENAME PATH)](DESTINATION URL)`

## Lists
- start each line with `- `, `* `, or `+ ` = unordered lists
- nested lists = any list can be nested, even ul-->ol or ol-->ul as long as you line up the colummns
- ordered lists = start each line with: a number, a period, a space -- `1. ` for example
- task list = `[ ]` (pending) or `[x]` (completed)
    - brackets go between the ul or ol syntax and the list item, ex: `- [ ] push it`

- horizontal rule = `***`, `---`, or `___`

- emojis! can be added by typing `:EMOJICODE:`, first with `:` to bring up a list of suggested emoji and narrowing as you type more, finally pressing **Tab** or **Enter** to select the highlighted emoji code.\

- footnotes = the initial reference (number) has this syntax: `[^NUMBER]`
    - the footnote itself (only shown at the bottom of the page) has `[^NUMBER]: ` for syntax
