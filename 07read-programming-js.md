### Control flow
- *control flow* is the order that the computer executes statements in a script
- control flow runs from the first line to the last line by default, but can also bounce around because of conditionals, loops, events, etc

## JavaScript functions
- *function* = a block of code designed to perform a particular task
- a function is executed when something invokes it (calls it)

- *parameter* = value listed in the parenthesis next to a function name
- *argument* = value in the parenthesis when invoking/calling a function


- variables declared within a function are local to the function and can only be accesssed from within the function; this is why sometimes variables are declared outside of functions
