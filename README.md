> # The Growth Mindset

### A Growth Mindset, In My Own Words
A growth mindset can be understood in a variety of ways -- one way that resonated with me is thinking of a growth mindset as a dynamic mindset, versus a static mindset (or fixed mindset as it's called). "Growth" and "fixed" can feel a little bit like loaded ideas, with "growth" being somewhat arbitrarily good, and "fixed" being bad. But if we think of them as being static vs dynamic, then a growth mindset becomes more compelling. Things are always changing and shifting, and keeping that in mind makes us more ready to adapt to our changing world and what's next. A growth mindset is better not just because it sounds better, but because we live in a "growing" world.
### Ways to Stay in a Growth Mindset
1. Remind myself why it matters: things are always changing, be **dynamic**, not *static*!
2. Growth isn't always "harder" -- a fixed mindset has its own downsides and costs
3. When I get discouraged, remember my passion for coding and tech!
