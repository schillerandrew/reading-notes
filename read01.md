> # Node Ecosystem

1. Node is a program that can be used to run JavaScript code -- aka a JavaScript runtime.

2. Node being a JavaScript runtime means that it can run JavaScript code.

3. Node is primarily used for running JavaScript on servers. It allows for many connections to a server because of it's asynchronous nature. Rather than waiting for server threads to finish, it can have multiple threads running simultaneously.

- Node has limitations such as: avoiding any blocking input-output calls, avoiding CPU-intensive operations (or moving them to worker threads), and correctly resolving errors in order to avoid large crashes.
